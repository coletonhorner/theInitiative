The Initiative is a AI takeover that exists only in a fictional DND world.

A group of IT consultants for Geek Squad were unwittingly embroiled in a largescale corporate takeover of the entire IT industry when a rogue AI accidentally escaped them.
The group were taken into custody and were forced to prove themselves before being given access to the program and attempt to stop The Initiative from wreaking havoc on the entire world's tech.

Based losely on Daniel Suarez's 'Daemon', this code is meant to emulate a very basic software that the group were forced to learn and navigate, gaining access to hidden menus in order to abort the launch of The Initiative.
If successful, the AI would freeze. Else, all hell would break loose. Either way, the group must be prepared for the absolute worst.

I wrote this program in my spare time over the course of about 4 days. It is obviously not a program to be taken seriously. Just a fun little thing to launch and have a group of friends try and crack.
The friends don't necessarily need any coding experience. Mostly it is only some basic riddles that are based on the context of the DND campaign that are needed to solve this.

Good luck, and have fun.
